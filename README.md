# Requirements for web development at ETARIX
I order to save you and us time, we have some requirements for the code. We sell high quality websites and the code is a main part of this. Therefore, we want to make sure that you as a developer stick to some basic claims. As well as an overall overview, we provide you with detailed documentation. These requirements are the foundation for a successful coperation and must be met. Please refrain from working together if you think you are not able to comply with the requirements. As well as a documentaion, we provide you with an example which covers code examples for the most frequent problems. As well as his you get a setup template you can use for all projects.
